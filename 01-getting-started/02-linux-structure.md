(a) Hardware Layer
ðŸ”¹ The physical components of the computer (CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, etc.).
ðŸ”¹ The OS interacts with hardware using device drivers.

(b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)
ðŸ”¹ The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management â€“ Schedules processes and handles multitasking.

    Memory Management â€“ Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.

    Device Drivers â€“ Acts as an interface between software and hardware.

    File System Management â€“ Manages how data is stored and retrieved.

    Network Management â€“ Handles communication between systems.

(c) System Utilities
ðŸ”¹ essential tools used to manage and configure various aspects of the operating system, including file and directory management, process management, network configuration, and system monitoring.

(d) System Libraries (glibc, libc, OpenSSL, etc.)
ðŸ”¹ a collection of pre-compiled code, or functions, that applications can use to perform common tasks.
ðŸ”¹ Code Reusability, Efficiency, Standardization, Maintainability.

(c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)
ðŸ”¹ A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
ðŸ”¹ Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
ðŸ”¹ Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.

(d) User Applications
ðŸ”¹ End-user programs like web browsers, text editors, DevOps tools, etc.
ðŸ”¹ Applications interact with the OS using system calls via the shell or GUI.
